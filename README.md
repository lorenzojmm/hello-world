# hello-world
Following this Hello World exercise to get started with GitHub. A place where I can store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

About me:

I don't really know any markdown elements at the moment. I plan on incorporating them once I learn them. 
A little about me:
I want to work for REI, The Walt Disney Company, Apple, Hawaiian Airlines, Booking.com, Babbel, N26, Rivian, Patagonia, Toptal, or Monzo Bank.

I was previously a conservation biology major. I changed majors. I love tech and nature. I love traveling. I believe in living sustainably. I love being able to spend time with my family. I seek a company that will allow me to feel happy, compensated and fulfilled, and excited to go to work. 

I look at work as more than just a way to get a paycheck. I look at it as an investment of my most precious resource- time. I take the company I choose to work for very seriously and hope some dreams can come true for me and my family.
